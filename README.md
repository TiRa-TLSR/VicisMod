# Vici's Mod
This is a mod I created for Fortress Craft Evolved, a game very similar to a
heavily modded minecraft but better. I'm hoping by sharing the source code for
my project, others may learn from me and maybe even contribute to it!

I hereby give permission for anyone to use my code for their own machines.
